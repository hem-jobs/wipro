All the work you will do is in the template folder
Create a seperate git branch for your uploads
# The templates you will use to work is in the demo folder

# Secondly, I want you to clean up the links on the pages
for instance ./ == ./index.html, ./about == ./about.html you will see samples on the header.php file inside template/layouts

Look at the header.php file inside template/layouts folder for Linking site assets

The routing file is the index.php on the top level 
How you link between the pages is with routes not the file names 
for a route to work, you will have to create a file with the name of the route inside the template/pages folder.

Happy coding!!!
